Interactive Dashboard
The objective of this project was to create an annual sales report so that the store owner can understand their customers and grow sales. First I did data cleaning and processing and then analysed the data using various pivot tables and charts and then lastly I created an interactive dashboard using slicers. The following insights were inferred:
1. Women are more likely to buy compared to men.
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states.
3. Old adults (30-49 years) make up half of the customers.
4. 80% of the sales happen on amazon, myntra and flipkart.

The store owner should target female customers of age 30-49 years living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by implementing marketing campaigns on amazon, myntra and flipkart.
